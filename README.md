Android_ComInj
==============

A prototype for showing that we can produce a command injection on a non-rooted Android device.


##Goals
1. Show that a command injection attack into Android is possible (you did this before I joined the project)
2. Show that a command injection attack into Android is fesible (Why would an android applicaiton use the runtime object?)
3. Show that a command injection attack into Android has the capacity to cause damage/gain some benefit to the attacker
4. Show that a command injection attack into Android can be prevented, and implement a method to prevent it (Ligatti/Donald have this one taken care of?)
5. 


###Un-Rooted Android Phone
1. Test shell commands - learn what we have access to
2. List inaccessible directories (create fully permissioned application and see if permissions extend to shell)


###Rooted Android Phone
1. Root the phone (Ask ligatti for possible university-funded phone? Would need to be old. Has added advantage of being easier to root?)
